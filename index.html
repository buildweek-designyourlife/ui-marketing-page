                <p>Life Design is a Wicked Problem. Wicket Problems are the type of challenge where finding one solution will cause other problems to arise. In choosing a path for your whole entire future, some people think they should just follow their
                    passion, and if it didn't work out- you didn't try hard enough, or you don't truely know yourself. With Design Thinking we will take a more systematic look at your activities and how they effect you.</p>
                <p>Our application is based on a class at <a href="http://lifedesignlab.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, and book called Designing Your Life. The most important principle of designing your life is that you don't really know what you want until
                    you have that experience. We don't want to pursue some goal that we discover we hate once attained. The <a href="*">Life Design App</a> will help you asses what you are doing NOW, and help you measure what activites make you stronger,
                    more focused and energized. This is what we want to do!</p>
