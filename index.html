            <h1>Life Design App</h1>
            <p> The Life Design Lab, as a class, applies 'design thinking' to the problems of vocational wayfinding and life. Our Life Design App adds an organizational framework, to streamline the homework and data collection you will need for design thinking
                to work. </p>

            <h2>Life Design is a Wicked Problem</h2>
            <p>A Wicked Problem is the type of challenge where finding one solution will cause other problems to arise. In choosing a path for your whole entire future, some people think they should just follow their passion, and if it didn't work out- you
                didn't try hard enough, or you don't truely know yourself. With Design Thinking we will take a more systematic look at your activities and how they effect you.</p>
            <p>Our application is based on a class at <a href="http://lifedesignlab.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, and book called Designing Your Life. The most important principle of designing your life is that you don't really know what you want until you
                have that experience. We don't want to pursue some goal that we discover we hate once attained. The <a href="*">Life Design App</a> will help you asses what you are doing NOW, and help you measure what activites make you stronger, more
                focused and energized. This is what we want to do!</p>
            Step one- Take the class from Stanford. Step two- use our app to help you record your activities and responses. Step 3- use the data to make better choices!</p>
