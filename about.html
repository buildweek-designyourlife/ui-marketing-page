            <h1>About the Team</h1>
            <p> This marketing page and app was provided by the Lambda School of wayward and aimless coders. This project had a provided Back End from Kenneth Johnson. This was harnessed by our awesome REACT coder Allie as she breathed life and beauty into
                this concept. All Life Design Concepts come from the book <i>"Design Your Life"</i> class and book from Stanford.</p>
